And for those who took motorcycle license would know, up to 2 bikes can wait in the junction, if there is oncoming traffic. That\u2019s how we were taught to form up\n\nAnd so that\u2019s what I did, I formed up behind the first bike in the junction. And we\u2019re both waiting at the correct position.

He told me it was because I proceeded with my right turn at the junction even though the light was red, and thus the immediate failure\n\nHe also told me that only 1 bike was allowed to wait in the junction, and that I should be waiting behind the white line instead, which contradicts what was taught in the school.

I got my motivation from my friend who was also interested in taking his 2B as well(said friend is currently on L7) so we started taking it together. \n\n\n\n**Theory Lessons**  \nTheory lessons are split into 3 groups, Basic Theory, Riding Theory, Defensive Riding Theory. Basic Theory and Riding Theory both have 2 lessons each, which are compulsory before you are able to do the respective Internal Evaluations. Defensive Riding Theory have 3 compulsory lessons but no test after, but are required before moving on to Lesson 6. Try to complete your theory lessons and tests ASAP as it could bottleneck your progress. One example would be that you will need to complete your BTT(Basic Theory Test) before you can move on to Lesson 6. Also regarding this, you will need to complete your DRT lessons before you can book your RTT(Riding Theory Test)\\[happened to the friend mentioned above\\].\n\n\n\n**General Lesson Structure and Bookings**  \nUnlike BBDC and SSDC, CDC doesn't go by Lesson 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2 etc. CDC just has Lesson 1-8, so technically you only have to pass 8 practicals(assuming first time pass everything) in order to book TP. However, lesson bookings are harder than SSDC and BBDC(can't confirm but it's what I heard from friends who took from those schools) as the next lesson can be around 1-2 weeks after. If you have the time, you could just keep refreshing the app and pray you find an earlier lesson. Personally, I didn't have any issue with bookings and was generally quite easy to find lessons. My tip would be to book multiple of the same lessons, especially lesson 5 and 8 as both are the assessments and have a higher failure rate than the others. For lesson 1, please book 2 lesson slots as well as they will fail you on the first time and it's the only lesson that requires you to do it twice(at least). \n\n\n\n**General Circuit Advice**  \nMany people have different methods or tricks that they use to make it easier for themselves. This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/pba6h3/my_class_2b_experience_at_comfortdelgro_driving/) has quite a few tips and tricks for every course. My personal advice is just book as many Circuit Revisions and Self Practices as possible to learn what works for you. \n\nOne main reason why you might fail is due to the bike that you choose. CDC offers 2 bike options after lesson 4, Yamaha YS125(black bike) and Suzuki GSX-S150(black and blue). The YS125s have been in service alot longer than the GSX-S150, so they might not be as well-maintained as the GSX-S150. Personally, the GSX-S150 feels alot easier and comfortable to use. \n\nThe main killer for the circuit is the plank. Many people fail their assessments, and sometimes TP, due to falling off the plank. My tip is to rev hard to get onto the plank, then just play with your rear brake. Some tips I have heard were to use the 'half-clutch technique' but personally I don't use it, I just let my clutch go once I get onto the plank. Once you are on the plank, focus on looking straight ahead(the pylon cones or tree) and not down at your speedometer or plank. If you feel yourself swaying, use minor adjustments or shift your body weight to stabilize yourself. If timing is the issue, I would recommend to just take the 4 points as its better than an IF(Immediate Failure). \n\n\n\n**Simulator**  \nSimulator is essentially a 20min arcade game and only unlocks once you have attended 5 lessons. Misconception is that you have to pass 5 lessons, but you only have to attend these 5, regardless of failure. For me, I went for L1 x2, L2 x1, L3 x2 so after my 2nd L3, I could book my simulator. Simulator bookings are the main source of delay as they could take up to 3 months before you can find a slot. I remember when I cleared my L3 in Oct, the earliest simulator slot was in Jan. My advice would be to keep refreshing to find earlier slots. \n\n\n\n**Road Portion**  \nRoad unlocks after Lesson 5. You will need to have completed BTT and have a PDL(Provisional Driving License). Road only consists of 2 lessons, 6 and 7. Lesson 6 is just a road orientation, where you will be following an instructor around and getting used to riding on the road. Lesson 7 is where you learn the road route, and learn how to do your U-Turn. You will go through the road route TWICE during the entire lesson so try to memorize the road route. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoxBOixDqas) personally helped me alot and I played it at least 5-6 times before my lesson 8 and TP. My advice for U-Turn is to just look towards the green road sign and it's just one simple right turn. You can actually practice your U-Turn in the nursery during Circuit Revisions as well.\n\n \n\n**Circuit and Road Revisions**  \nThese will become your best friends and unlock once you have cleared lesson 4 and lesson 7 respectively. I went for 6 Circuit Revs and 0 Road Revs, but I recommend booking at least 1 or 2 Road Revs. For Circuit Revs, there are no instructors accompanying you and you are free to do anything within the circuit. Just practice as much as you want for that 1h40mins that you have. Try and avoid the 1245 and 1850 slots as those are the more common timeslots for assessments, so there will be more people on the circuit. For Road Revs, you will only go through the road route twice. Any remaining time will be spent in the circuit. Also, use this time to practice and try out different bikes. I kept a log of every bike I used and which ones I felt the most comfortable using. This will be useful for your TP test as you have the option of reserving your preferred bike.\n\n\n\n**Assessments(Lesson 5 and 8)**  \nThese are basically mini TP tests that have the same structure. My general advice for assessments it to take the bibs with higher numbers(like 8-14 that kind). This is because you will be released based on your bib number, and if you are the first one, generally there is more pressure on you. \n\nLesson 5  \nThis is the circuit assessment where you will be applying what you have learned from lessons 1-4. You will be going through the entire circuit route(Slope > Fig 8 > Crank > Plank > Pylon Slalom > Emergency Brake). Unlike TP, you only have 10 demerit points to work with. You will start with a warmup round, then proceed on to the actual assessment. For the Fig 8 and Plank, there will be a blinker light stationed right before the course. ONLY move off once the blinker light is up. If you move off without the blinker light, it will be considered an Immediate Failure. 1 tip I can give is that if you didn't see the blinker light, just wait there. The instructor will blink it one more time for you. There is a chance that you might get 2 demerit points for 'delay in moving off' if that happens. Once you have completed, the instructors will compile the results and give you a slip with your results. The slip will show whether you pass or fail, as well as how many demerit points and Immediate Failures you have. For mine, I had to take lesson 5 3 times before I passed. First time, 28 points 3 IFs(don't ask, even I can't tell you what happened). Second time, 4 points 1 IF. Third time, 10 Points 0 IFs(finally passed).\n\nLesson 8  \nThis is essentially your mock TP. It will be the circuit assessment(lesson 5) + road assessment. Same as TP, you will have 18 demerit points to work with. The entire process is exactly the same as lesson 5. The main difference is that once you come back from the circuit portion. You will park your bike, and be on standby to move on to the road portion. There is no warmup unlike the circuit portion. There will be 2 instructors following, 1 at the front and 1 at the back. Don't blindly follow the person in front of you. Also take note of the stopping points. There might be times where 1 of the instructors are left behind due to the traffic lights, so you have to stop and wait for them before you can move off again. This only applies to lesson 8 and not TP. \n\n\n\n**TP Test**  \nThis will be a full day experience, so I suggest you keep that entire day free(most of it is waiting tbh). Regarding the reservation of bikes, you have to do so before the day itself. My recommendation is to book a Circuit Rev a day or 2 before your test and book it from there. At the counter, there will be a black file where you can reserve your bike. Payment will only be made on the test day.\n\nYour day begins before the sun rises at 0645. You will be collecting your number tags and signing off for your reserved bike. Number tags are arranged as such; foreigners first, then oldest to youngest. You will then move over to the training shed where you will be preparing for your warmup. Take the warmup as you would an assessment. Once you come back from warmup, you will be waiting for the tester to come. At 0830, the testers will be here to brief everyone, and check for your NRIC and PDL. This is where you will pay for your reserved bike($16.52 if I'm not mistaken). For those who have reserved bikes, it is NOT a guarantee that you will be using your reserved bike for warmup(I used a different one as well). \n\nOnce done, you will be released in batches of 10 to do your circuit portion of your test. Don't be nervous and just do the circuit as you have been practicing. Make sure to check all blind spots and check backs. One tip I can give is to put stickers on your helmet, so testers can actually see you turning your head. Once everyone has completed the circuit portion, you will be released for a short break while the testers compile the results. Most of the failures on the day will be from this part of the test. For mine, 11 out of 59 failed here. To be very honest, I thought I failed here too since I dropped my right leg twice during the entire test(both times in front of testers as well) but apparently I made it through. After this, you will then move on to the road portion of the test. \n\nSimilar to the circuit portion, you will be released in batches of 10. There will be no instructors with you, unlike your assessments and road revs, so its common to not see anyone around you during this portion. At around 1100, you will be released and should complete by around 1130. Again, you will have a short break until 1145 for the testers to compile the final results. The general consensus is that those who made it to the road portion are almost guaranteed to pass. However, don't rely solely on that and get complacent as you could be on 18 points after the circuit and 1 missed blind spot check could ruin everything. In my case, out of the remaining 48, 3 failed here(not exactly sure why since they were not with me). The remaining 45 of us all passed. Again, to be very honest, I thought I failed here too as my U-Turn was very wide(literally centimeters from hitting the kerb). The results will be released by 1200 and those who pass can move on to the Expressway Familiarization Ride. \n\nThere will be 2 slots released for this on the same day, 1245 and 1435. If you are unable to make it, you are still able to book for another day. However, you are unable to apply for your QDL until you have completed your EFR. The EFR is the most fun you will have at CDC. You will go from CDC along PIE towards SAFRA Tampines, then go back to CDC. The entire ride will take about 40 mins to 1h. Don't be afraid to go fast as you will be in gear 5 and hitting 80km/h consistently. Remember your road rules during lesson 6 and ride safely. Once you have completed it, you will proceed to close your CDC account and in a few hours, you can apply for your QDL. Any remaining funds inside your account will be refunded to you within 1-3 working days. \n\n\n\n**Re-training**  \nIf you were to fail your TP test, you have to attend 1 re-training session before you can book another one. It is basically another road revision so just do the re-training then go for another TP test. \n\n\n\n**Conclusion**  \nYour 2B journey will be long and tedious. It is completely normal to fail some lessons, just don't lose that motivation. If you were to ask me if I would recommend learning at CDC, my answer would be yes. For me, I enrolled at CDC mainly due to convenience(I live in Sengkang). I didn't know about the difference in lesson structure at the 3 schools so that wasn't in my consideration. However, after talking with some friends from SSDC and BBDC, they told me how many lessons they had to do, which made me realize how lucky I was to have chosen CDC. One of them from SSDC took over 20 lessons just to get his license. Other than the number of lessons required, the instructors at CDC are also very strict but give very good tips. I remember I had to retake my lesson 3 due to my poor fig 8. I couldn't gear up in time before entering the course, and the one time that I could, I crashed straight into the tree in front of me(apologies to those who had to use bike number 18 after that). One of the instructors came up to me and made me practice in the nursery while giving me tips on how I can improve. On my second attempt at lesson 3, I was able to do fig 8 with a sub 10s timing. Overall, I found the entire experience to be very fun and don't regret choosing CDC at all(will be coming back here for my 2A and 2 eventually). \n\nAll in all, it took me 6 months(12/9/24 to 12/3/25) and $1,103.27 to complete my 2B license.

You NEED to have a clear mental image in order to execute it properly because you cannot literally see the entire vehicle while inside.\n\nThat you actually make the same mistakes again in practice, plus you're thinking about striking the kerb when in fact you should be thinking about how to drive such that you will not hit the kerb, implies that your mental image is problematic - you should be running simulations in your head of how to correctly operate your vehicle and not how things are going to go wrong. Are you aware of how much your wheels move when you turn the steering wheel? If you can picture the tyres of your vehicle while driving, you will never mount a kerb.

Someone told me they're not really from TP, rather they have been outsourced (like military testers I think from what I've heard). My first 2 tests, even though I felt I was ready, these testers made me soooo nervous with their side comments (\"should you have done that?\" , \"idk why you ask me\") esp when asked to clarify the instructions.\n\n For etc, my first tester asked to turn right in the circuit & there was only 1 way to turn right. He then made me feel like I turned into the wrong lane & smirked  at me like I had just failed & proceeded not to say anythin, I had to ask him where to go after that. I realised after clarifying with my instructor that I was not in the wrong, the tester was. I still went out to road for that test. I even received points for mistakes I had almost made but not made yet lol. Sooo frustrating as I felt it was quite unfair at how they can easily fail you as & when.\n \nI even know of someone who had to argue with one of these testers to not give IF cause they were not the one to make the mistake (a motorbike learner nearby made a mistake). At the end, that person was sooo upset at the attitude of the tester rather than be happy at passing. \n\nCan I get your thoughts/opinions on this especially those who have just passed recently/those with similar experiences.

I'm a girl and did my 2B at BBDC during COVID, so some of the lessons I did were modified to accomodate restrictions and my treatment could have been biased (though not that I noticed). Between 5 of us who went for motorcycle lessons at all 3 centres for our class 2B/2A/2, 3 of us have already gotten our licenses up to class 2A/2, and one has quit entirely.\n\n\nCircuit comparisons between BBDC/SSDC/CDC:\n(This is based on our class 2A/2 experience, as class 2B was long enough ago that I can't remember if the circuit is the same)\n\nBBDC appears to have the easiest circuit amongst the 3 centres. When comparing the test routes within the circuits directly, my friends and I ranked BBDC as the easiest, with CDC close behind. CDC has one additional small component during the test, one right/left turn out that has a wall blocking your view at CDC. S course -> crank course at BBDC is slightly easier to handle as well due to circuit layout.\n\nFor the circuit at SSDC, it's the most difficult as in addition to the car learners (who can 100% screw you up), there are also class 4 bus/truck drivers to be mindful of. The circuit also had additional passes through the controlled junction (with the trucks) which BBDC and CDC didn't have. My friend did class 2B at BBDC and 2A at SSDC and had a much harder time passing at SSDC with multiple retries. Another friend did it at CDC and to my recollection, failed class 2B and 2A once each. I did both 2B and 2A and BBDC and passed on the first try for both (of course, this is up to the rider and the evaluators on your test date).\n\n\nFor class 2B:\n\nMy friends and I did our class 2B at BBDC/CDC. Lessons are easier to book on the BBDC website, with less waiting time and no limit on how often you can access the website, but do note you can email directly in to CDC in order to book lessons that are >2 weeks from when you send the email if you want to confirm a specific time slot or so.\n\nIf you are short, BBDC has a smaller bike you can use. CDC does not. Not sure about SSDC for class 2B.\n\nEquipment you need to buy/wear: \nBBDC will give you a hair cover for when you use the school helmets on enrollment, and you can purchase those durian gloves if you really need it at the driving school. BBDC requires you to wear long sleeve and long pants for lessons, and knee/elbow pads for the first few lessons. BBDC provides helmets/knee pads/elbow pads at the school should you want to use those. In comparison, CDC does not require long sleeved shirts, but you must purchase your own elbow/knee pads for lessons and (from my understanding) some kind of hair covering for the school helmets.\n\nFor the lessons themselves: \nThe lessons at BBDC seem to be structured better. The things you need to clear at each driving centre appear to be in the same order, but BBDC breaks each overall lesson down into smaller groups. For example lesson 1 at both centres expects you to learn how to ride forward then waddle back, ride in the baby circuit, the learn how to shift up to (I think) gear 3. At CDC, you are expected to go for lesson 1 a minimum of 2 times to pass (average of 3 times, according to one of the instructors when my friend went) since the lesson has 2 parts. On the other hand, BBDC will break lesson 1 up into multiple parts so that it's clear cut from the start that lesson 1.1 is to learn how to turn on the motorcycle and waddle back, lesson 1.2 you learn how to go around the circuit, etc. (Not sure how accurate the breakdown is, I did it 5 years ago during covid and the nursery circuit area was not available) \n\nThe lessons being broken down into clear subsections at BBDC can be a good or bad thing, depending on your confidence level. Because more time is spent on a clear curriculum for each 1.5h sub lesson at BBDC, I think it's easier to focus on just that component and pass vs. at CDC trying the whole lesson again (incl the part you're already ok with) only to still suck at one particular part and fail.  However, if you're confident then CDC may be faster to pass each lesson.\n\nFor the girls: This is subjective and definitely instructor dependent, but I never had any experiences with instructors being sexist or bad treatment at BBDC. In comparison, 2 of my female friends attending lessons at CDC had instructors scolding them excessively in comparison to the men (for dropping the bike/not knowing how to handle the bike during lesson 1), to the point where emails were sent up higher to complain about the particular instructor, and some action was taken by the lead/head instructor. I have no idea if it has changed by now (this happened late last year), but something to think about. Because of the treatment at CDC, the friend who wrote in about the instructor eventually ended up dropping the lessons altogether, and my other friend is going to switch to BBDC.\n\n\nOther than the driving school lessons themselves:\n\nI would suggest learning how to ride a bicycle well first if you can't already! A lot of skills are transferable over from the bicycle to the motorcycle, and I think the fact I used to cycle to school every day in pri/sec school made it a lot easier for me to learn how to ride a motorcycle. \n\nAdditionally, if you want to ride a motorcycle outside of the lessons, DON'T USE A FRIENDS BIKE TO DO IT. I saw a post recently how someone got in trouble and may face license suspension because someone wanted to learn outside of the lessons at the driving centre. If you do want to try riding a motorcycle, there are dirt bike trails in JB that are open even to non-riders, and the guides will have a morning session to teach the non-riders how to ride. Their instruction is actually pretty good (considering you have only the morning to learn before going to the trail, should you choose to do so) but of course, the environment there is very different than at the driving centre. The skills for dirt biking are also different than daily riding. I've seen people trying to teach their friends how to ride in HDB carparks before and I don't think it's worth your friend losing their license over you wanting to try their bike, so this is just my 2 cents.\n\n\nThat's all I got, I hope this is useful, I was just bored and decided to write this out.

Well if companies in SG start to bring in the same concept then I think it be good especially when we got alot of people using motorbikes for deliveries. However when it comes to different brands, some may use propietary batteries so its important that all the companies work towards a standardised charging that can work on different brands so that its cross compatible otherwise you see alot of different brands and their own battery swapping stations which will get messy.

No option to buy CDW for short term rentals.\n\nThe condition of the car itself in all honesty is quite disgusting. \n\n\\- Exterior: Dusty, full of dirty watermarks, to the point where you almost cannot see through the windows. Various fake carbon fibre plastic pieces attached to different parts of the car. Bumper, fuel cap, side vents, you name it. Upgraded exhaust to HKS system, which is the only nice thing about this car IMO.\n\n\\- Interior: Also dusty, peeling leather seats and a steering wheel cover to hide the condition of the steering wheel. DIY interior lights that were poorly installed, with more fake carbon fibre plastic pieces on the interior. A lot of these were stuck on using double-sided tape, which made the car feel very cheap and \"beng\". It also trapped a lot of dust underneath, which as you can imagine wasn't cleaned.\n\nAll these complaints are subject to personal preference. I just like cars that are clean and stock. But it's very obvious that this car has been sitting around for a very long time.\n\nThe thing that I find unacceptable is that the car didn't have working headlights. In hindsight, it was stupid of me not to check something so basic before I drove off, because I only realised when I reached my home carpark and saw only the DRLs were on. I had to bring the car back to the company the next day for about 10 minutes to get the fuse replaced.\n\nThe upgraded HKS exhaust sounds nice, but I don't think it was installed properly because it was very loose and kept banging against the undercarriage of the car when I drove. The sound was quite distracting and made me keep thinking I hit something with the car.\n\nI'm someone that likes to drive, and sometimes I rent cars just to try them out. This is the first time that I didn't enjoy the driving experience, which says a lot about the quality of the car, because I even enjoyed driving a Corolla.\n\nThe good thing is the sales guy was quite responsive on whatsapp, and he was also a chill guy. Shout out to Vincent. When I returned the car he also barely checked for damage because the car is already basically a piece of shit lol.\n\nOverall, I don't think I will go back to rent from them again. The rental fee is definitely cheap for a C-HR, but in the end the car got so many issues like poor cleanliness, poor maintenance. I rather pay a bit extra for a clean car with no problems, even if I have to downgrade to a sedan. The expensive insurance excess with no option to buy CDW also doesn't help.", "created_utc": 1741100875.0, "score": 16, "num_comments": 11, "flair": "Personal Experience", "author": "zzzz_zach", "comments": [{"id": "mfzptkm", "text": "Actually not sure if i responded to your post last time but i remembering telling few people in this channel to avoid oz car rental as few people got scammed by them for damages that cant even be seen through naked eyes.", "created_utc": 1741108602.0, "score": 8, "author": "chickenegro"}, {"id": "mg0dxu5", "text": "$10k excess\u2026 At this rate I rather go for car sharing then", "created_utc": 1741115298.0, "score": 7, "author": "Reasonable-Ferret-96"}, {"id": "mg30jba", "text": "Only their Avante CN7 which was the one i rented from them were well maintained prob because it is their new and most rented vehicle \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "created_utc": 1741143861.0, "score": 2, "author": "Classic_Engine5346"}, {"id": "mgag82w", "text": "I would strongly recommend Dream Car Leasing @ Kaki Bukit if you would like.

Cam car overtook quite close to the lane splitter, who was riding slower than cam car la and refused to slow down when the car in front of him slowed.

Honestly was super fun. Bike was light, and nimble. Loved the burning 2t smell. You can rev it damn high, and when the powervalves open, you get a burst.\n\n- Carbureted. Older bike, less complicated maintenance. No need to pay for some diagnostic tool. Carbs are simpler to maintain, but gotta take care of it more frequently.\n\n- Can mod to go faster. Heard stories of people modding their KR to go to absurd speeds for a 150cc. Personally I couldnt afford to do this, kept everything stock and original.\n\n- Iconic. Its a legendary bike. Self explanatory.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- No electric start. Gotta learn how to kickstart the bike. You'd think that its easy, but lets say you cant start the bike, and at this point youre already sweating. Now you gotta try and run start the bike AND THEN kick in hopes itll start. Or lets say it rained while your bike was not parked under shelter. When mine didnt start initially, I kicked till I almost gave up. Dad advised to engage kill switch, kick for a few mins, then disengage kill switch, turn off the lights, engage the choke, and then kick. This worked, and was normal practice for me everytime i left my bike in the rain. \n\n- Its a old bike. Could be older than you. You will never know how many owners the bike has gone through (can check ofc but you get what I mean). Any number of those owners could have neglected the bike. Imagine the amount of accidents with the bike. When i got my bike, I sent it in for a full overhaul and afterwards the bike ran smoothly. Your mileage WILL vary for old bikes.\n\n- You actually have to warm up the bike. If its cold, you have to engage the choke, start the bike and listen. Youre gonna be waiting for the bike to warm up then you can disengage the choke and finally move off. If you dont do this, the bike either wont start or will die intermittently.\n\n- Govt wants to phase out the bike. Back then owners of KRs of certain range of date of manufacture were offered rebates if they scrapped their bikes. I wasnt so lucky, my bike just missed the mark. I just exported it out instead for some measly amount. \n\n- Parts are even harder to get nowadays, I believe. When I first got my KR, I was spoilt for choice. Every workshop had em for sale. 2 years later after NS, it became a rarity. That was back in 2020, now I barely ever see any KRs on the street. I could hazard that the parts situation is probably the same, considering its out of production.\n\n- Insurance was insane. I dont know if its worse than the others but I was always under the impression that they jacked up the premiums because Im young, and cos the KR is a notorious bike.\n\nAll in all it was a great and fun bike. I had to actually learn to handle the quirks of the bike, but I guess that made it more endearing. Honestly Id recommend that you consider the others instead. They are way more modern and youd probably have a smoother experience with them. \n\nOR you could buy a cheap scooter, get your class 2A and 2 and never look back!", "created_utc": 1740620937.0, "score": 2, "author": "LividRed"}, {"id": "mexlxd5", "text": "I was surprised to find out 2 strike RS125s still exist when I saw one at a petrol kiosk", "created_utc": 1740596281.0, "score": 1, "author": "eugenechuapw"}, {"id": "mf15clg", "text": "I rented a R15 and my thought was, \"might as well ride kapchai sial\". krr was my first bike back in 2006 and it was heaps of fun. imo for 4 stroke sportsbikes, wait for 2a lah.", "created_utc": 1740638810.0, "score": 1, "author": "blahhh87"}, {"id": "mf5j8sg", "text": "Used to own a KRR back then.

I would strongly not recommend a E46 if you dont have basic mechanic knowledge e.g changing oil, flushing fluids and some other miscellaneous stuff like changing headlight bulbs). All these costs money and in SG, the stuff listed above would probably cost upwards of 2k at any workshop. When it comes to finding replacement parts I wouldn't say it's difficult and with the power of Internet and AI, you can easily find a part your car needs. Since its a old car, your PPI will definitely not come out well and engine/gearbox aside, I forsee you spending an extra 5k++ to get the car working in a desirable condition. \n\nIn SG, most of us aren't really mechanically inclined and your opinions you get from bimmerpost or any bmw forums might differ because in the USA for example, there is a higher percentage of owners who know how to wrench on their cars. The e46 330i is also a dream of mine to own but after owning 2 BMWs (e90 and f30), I'd say you should stay away from an e46 unless you're ready to fix it up. \n\nGood luck!

As the lesson was somewhat late and my test was slightly more than twelve hours after my lesson, I felt that I should get ready to book my\u00a0third\u00a0TP test as I was not feeling confident. The next day, during the TP test warm-up, I got\u00a0a\u00a0really helpful warm-up instructor\u00a0who\u00a0basically told me to take it slow, as she\u00a0could\u00a0feel that I was\u00a0very\u00a0nervous and that my turns\u00a0were\u00a0almost always wide due to my\u00a0mind\u00a0going blank when I panicked.  \n  \nWhile waiting on the\u00a0second\u00a0level, I saw someone else had two\u00a0testers,\u00a0and they called out another person. I started praying that I would only get one tester.\u00a0When\u00a0a tester came out and\u00a0called\u00a0my name, I saw that he was the only one, so I\u00a0felt\u00a0kind of\u00a0relieved.\u00a0Then,\u00a0another guy\u00a0dressed\u00a0in a shirt and jeans, wearing sunglasses with a police lanyard\u00a0,\u00a0said he\u00a0would\u00a0be following me for the test. After entering the car, he started explaining the test,\u00a0and\u00a0then he asked me to make a left turn to start.\u00a0However,\u00a0since it was during session two, there was\u00a0downtime\u00a0between\u00a0BBDC\u00a0sessions\u00a0one and two, so there\u00a0were\u00a0almost no\u00a0cars\u00a0on the circuit.\u00a0For\u00a0the first turn, I was asked to make a right turn at 12 and another turn at 25 (which I almost missed at 12 since I\u00a0thought\u00a0it was a two-directional change; I forgot that right\u00a0turns\u00a0come before the number and left\u00a0turns\u00a0come\u00a0after). I\u00a0ended\u00a0up wide-turning into the correct lane before being asked to do the crank course.\u00a0During\u00a0the\u00a0warm-up, my instructor gave me a tip to turn later into the course if I was right-turning to give myself space, which I managed to do without making\u00a0many\u00a0mistakes.\u00a0  \n  \nHe\u00a0then asked me to make a left turn into PP, right outside the crank course. During PP, I saw both of them\u00a0take\u00a0out their\u00a0phones\u00a0and\u00a0start\u00a0a timer, which gave me even more stress.\u00a0However,\u00a0I managed to go slow and check all my blind\u00a0spots\u00a0(\u00a0I\u00a0was able to get into the lot in\u00a02\u00a0minutes and 30\u00a0seconds\u00a0with no need for\u00a0corrections\u00a0). I was then asked to move out of the lot and\u00a0make a\u00a0right turn at the stop line (after reaching the stop line, I noticed that I\u00a0hadn't\u00a0adjusted\u00a0the mirror,\u00a0so\u00a0I started doing that at the stop line, but the tester\u00a0didn't\u00a0catch it since he was writing something\u00a0down\u00a0on paper) before being directed to directional change at number nine, which required\u00a0me\u00a0to use additional reverse to get out of it because I felt I was too close to the\u00a0curb\u00a0in\u00a0front. I was told to turn\u00a0right\u00a0at 12, then go to 51 for the slope, which I managed to clear.\u00a0As\u00a0I was going down, he wanted me to turn left, but right as I reached the stop line, he\u00a0told\u00a0me to signal right, despite having a massive traffic\u00a0buildup.\u00a0I had to wait for around 20+ cars to pass before two kind instructors gave way to me. The next station was the S course, which I was not feeling confident about as I had repeatedly mounted\u00a0the\u00a0curb yesterday. I had to\u00a0make a\u00a0right turn into the course,\u00a0and\u00a0I felt that I turned too early as the vehicle in front of me had not\u00a0reached\u00a0the middle.\u00a0While\u00a0doing the S course, I felt that I was doing fine as I was in the middle of the course before turning slightly early. I had to make a right turn out of the S course into\u00a0vertical\u00a0parking, during which I\u00a0accidentally\u00a0peeked\u00a0at my tester paper\u00a0and\u00a0saw numbers like 12, 9, 4. I thought\u00a0it\u00a0was my DP and that I had failed, but I\u00a0knew\u00a0that\u00a0overthinking\u00a0wouldn't\u00a0do me\u00a0any\u00a0good, so I just continued with my\u00a0vertical\u00a0parking\u00a0while\u00a0both of them took out\u00a0their\u00a0phones\u00a0and started timing. When I was going into the lot, my left rear wheel was basically right next to the\u00a0curb,\u00a0and\u00a0I was kind of scared it would hit, so I\u00a0made\u00a0a correction and was slightly too far to the right of the lot,\u00a0requiring\u00a0another correction\u00a0.\u00a0While checking my side mirror and blind spot\u00a0,\u00a0I saw that I had less than 20\u00a0seconds\u00a0left, so I started reversing into the lot\u00a0as\u00a0quickly\u00a0as\u00a0possible, forgetting to do one more rear blind spot check but I went neutral and applied the handbrake just in time.  \n  \nThinking I had failed, I was so ready to drive back to the lots, but I\u00a0was\u00a0instructed to make a left turn and exit the circuit at 50, which\u00a0meant\u00a0I\u00a0hadn't\u00a0failed yet\u00a0.\u00a0However,\u00a0there was no\u00a0e-brake\u00a0test yet, so while driving to the exit, I was ready to brake at\u00a0any\u00a0time.\u00a0After\u00a0reaching the stop line, I noticed for the\u00a0second\u00a0time that I had not\u00a0adjusted\u00a0my\u00a0mirrors back.\u00a0While\u00a0I was at the stop\u00a0line,\u00a0I adjusted the mirrors, and luckily the tester was writing something again, so he\u00a0didn't\u00a0see me adjust. After I exited\u00a0BBDC,\u00a0I went on test route 1 and\u00a0drove\u00a0until\u00a0I\u00a0approached a stop sign with a car behind\u00a0me\u00a0and a bus that had just\u00a0stopped\u00a0to my right.\u00a0After\u00a0counting to 2, I wanted to move off\u00a0as\u00a0soon as possible, but I\u00a0hadn't\u00a0brought\u00a0my gear back to 1, so midway through moving, I\u00a0switched\u00a0it back to gear 1, then to 2 before approaching a zebra crossing. I saw\u00a0that\u00a0there\u00a0were\u00a0people coming quite\u00a0a\u00a0distance away,\u00a0and\u00a0I wanted to stop just\u00a0in\u00a0case.\u00a0Then suddenly, some random guy ran across the road right as I stopped\u00a0(kind of lucky that I decided to stop; otherwise, that\u00a0could\u00a0have been the\u00a0end\u00a0of\u00a0the test). I then\u00a0followed\u00a0the test route all the way back to\u00a0BBDC,\u00a0and I thought I might have failed\u00a0due\u00a0to the random guy running across the road. I was asked to go to level 2 and sit in a room while\u00a0they\u00a0processed my test result.\u00a0While\u00a0waiting for my test result, there\u00a0were\u00a02 other people in the room, and they both failed, which made me even more anxious. I then saw both my\u00a0testers\u00a0walk\u00a0in,\u00a0and\u00a0one of them started explaining the mistakes to me. At first, I saw a lot of ticks and thought I had failed\u00a0,\u00a0but then I\u00a0noticed\u00a0they were mostly ticked in the boxes with a line inside them, meaning there was a good chance I had\u00a0passed\u00a0, which he then\u00a0confirmed\u00a0by asking if I\u00a0had\u00a0any license on me as he said I had\u00a0passed\u00a0.  \nI then proceeded to level 1 to do a survey and was\u00a0asked\u00a0to go to CS to either close my account or sign up for DOC, which I booked a lesson for this coming\u00a0Monday\u00a0(I still had to wait over an hour to book my DOC). Are there any tips for a new P-plate driver with a family car\u00a0that\u00a0has just slightly over one year left on\u00a0COE?\u00a0Do\u00a0I need to get insurance to drive the car or be added to the insurance? I heard the premium will be\u00a0higher\u00a0as I am a P-plate driver.  \n  \nNow that I have passed and had time to think, I\u00a0feel\u00a0that I was really lucky to pass on my\u00a0second\u00a0attempt. I only\u00a0had\u00a0one revision lesson between my\u00a0first\u00a0test and\u00a0second\u00a0test, and I\u00a0learned\u00a0not to overthink whatever the tester is writing down during the test.

This statement can create harmful situations for a newbie who reads this info. \n\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the manual for a Skoda Kodiaq, a common non-American, decent choice of car in SG and a model that is also available on GetGo:\n\n\nhttps://s3cf792cad773e861.jimcontent.com/download/version/1612601933/module/15688226722/name/Skoda%20Kodiaq%20Owner%27s%20Manual.pdf\n\n\n> Octane number\n> Use the petrol with the octane number prescribed for your vehicle.\nPetrol with an octane number that is one higher than the one prescribed for your vehicle can be used without restriction.\n\u2022 NOTICE\nRisk of damage to the engine and the exhaust sys-tem!\n\u2022 If petrol is used that has an octane number that is lower than the one prescribed for your vehicle, then drive at moderate speeds with minimal engine stress.\n\u2022 Fill up with the prescribed octane number as soon as possible.\n\u2022 Do not use petrol with an octane number that lower than 91!\n\n\nAnd other sources including car magazine websites outside the US refer to RON and octane interchangeably as well:\n\n\nhttps://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/premium-unleaded-whats-the-difference\n\n\n> The general rule of thumb is that older cars will happily accept anything from standard 91 unleaded all the way up to premium 98 octane petrol.\n\n\nIt\u2019s more of a difference between units of octane in regions around the world. Context highly matters. You don\u2019t need to second-guess yourself if you\u2019re in a rental high-performance car in Australia and they ask if you want 92 octane or 98 octane and you say 92 octane because so called 92 AKI = 98 RON, and scold the pump attendant just because he tells you he\u2019s pumping \u201c98 octane\u201d instead of \u201cRON 98\u201d fuel after reading your incorrect comment (98 AKI would be really expensive race gas already), or panic because a reference website/book like the Skoda manual said \u201cminimum octane of 91\u201d instead of \u201cRON 91\u201d. Just remember which country you\u2019re in, and the website\u2019s country and you\u2019re golden. \n\n\nEven other non-English speaking countries also refer to it as well, the equivalent of \u201coctane\u201d, interchangeably with \u201cRON\u201d. https://otodriver.com/amp/berita/2025/ternyata-ini-dampak-yang-terjadi-jika-mobil-berstandar-bbm-oktan-92-menggunakan-oktan-90-terebdhen90\n\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely correct and common in the world outside US/Canada to refer to RON as octane, just as AKI as octane in US/Canada, no need to get your hands up all over it.

He replied asking me if was legal or not and there was a brief convo where i was convincing him that it is just normal gum and nothing illegal ( just a mint). It was not a great start cos he was not happy at all, but it kinda helped me because I got kinda annoyed that he making such a fuss about just gum. I was told by instructors you can take sweet or something to calm your nerves. After that, I think that just helped me completely shut him out I just thought to myself I am not gonna worry about the tester just do each station on the circuit like how I would do It in normal lesson. Its definitely hard to think of it that way because you spend so much money and you have so much on the line, but think about it at one point you will pass and get your license and the test is just to see whether what has been taught to will be practiced. \n\nThe nerves seriously make it or break it, I remember my leg was wobbling on the clutch soo badly on the first two test attempts. I went in to the 3rd try not expecting too much, just thinking I am just gonna go and do whatever I know. \n\nDon't give the test so much power, just go slow and remember do what you need to do at each station to the best of your ability. Once you go out on the road it should be second nature to check and to be safe. \n\nExaggerate a bit here and there maybe even start saying out what you have to do, that can also kinda distract them from mistakes you make and focus on how \"safe\" your being. \n\n1st attempt and 2nd attempt I didn't make it past circuit. 1st try I failed cos i was not confident of the circuit rules, where to wait when someone is parking or doing directional change, these things are important make sure you're familiar with the circuit rules. During my 1st attempt, just moving off from the parking lot, I didn't put down the handbrake fully and the tester sighed and my confidence just poof gone. My leg start wobbling, I turn wrong angle, hit kerb during directional change. Had to go back cos accumulated too many points. \n\n2nd attempt I went in the confident, my tester was a damn nice guy,  I was mentally prepared. 5 mins in, 3rd station was vertical parking, go there hit left side kerb cos I turn too early, shag, I was so done cos all that money gone soo fast. he said IF and then while moving out of the VP lot I mount kerb cos i didnt care anymore, I jus zoom back to the stop point. \n\nFor those who are still continuing after your first or second or nth attempt, just keep going man. For circuit must try to be confident of every station and know your turning points, where to check if you gonna hit kerb during parking and must know the circuit rules sometimes they will ask you do some weird diagonal lane change. Once you can master the circuit and be confident of your ability, during the test just tell yourself to imagine nobody is next to you you just have to do it correctly and safely. \n\n  \nDon't give up, however many tries you take it is not sign of how good or bad of a driver you are. During the test chew gum or take a sweet if you need to. You are trying to show that you are competent and safe, so be confident. Don't need to tell everyone you got test coming up, fail then fail, if its not the 3rd try it'll be the 4th and if its not the 4th it'll be the 5th, nobody cares just go get your license.  \n\nLastly before you go for the test remind yourself \" I am Dominic Toretto, Dominic Toretto wont hit the kerb\"\n\n  \n", "created_utc": 1740063433.0, "score": 37, "num_comments": 6, "flair": "TP Test", "author": "nikeproteinbus", "comments": [{"id": "mdwlq6b", "text": "Pass in on my first try with 8DP, all DP is incorrect breaking cuz I break hard, haha, almost immediate failure as I almost entered yellow box, but I break super hard.

On that basis (skill), I would not consider PHV/taxi drivers \"professional drivers\" as almost anyone can immediately start doing that job if they can operate a car legally. They're just operating a motor vehicle within legal limits on public roads. Not everybody can be a racing driver, which generally involves driving at the limit in challenging and competitive circumstances. Besides, you have jobs like real estate and door to door sales that involve lots of driving for their jobs - are they also \"professional drivers\" too? Some businessmen even drive regularly to Malaysia, clocking more mileage than the typical cabbies - professional driver also? Makes no sense, lah.\n\n>Though I find it funny that a racer ask people to give way. Don\u2019t think that how championships are won. Haha.\n\nBecause there is a huge difference between driving legally and safely on the public roads vs driving in a professional racing environment, where other participants have also signed up for the same risks as you, and the rules are very different.

Is the new car a need or a want? If it is a want, can skip pt.2,3,4,5. Go straight to pt.6\n2. Is the current car driving well, and do you foresee any upcoming major wear and tear replacements / repairs? You can take reference from the experience of other owners with the same make (car groups / clubs on FB / Forum / Telegram). For example, some cars are known to require their engine mounts replaced at around the 3rd year mark, or after a certain mileage.\n3. Is it a common car make that has previous generations still on the road (after 10 years), such as the Toyota Altis, Hyundai Avante, Honda Civics... It is a good indicator about the kind of technical support you will get after warranty period is over, and whether it is a good idea to renew COE.\n4. How much proprietary technology is there in the current car? For example, if you are driving a relatively new Mercedes that is running on MBUX 6, you have to take into account that a lot of the workshops do not have the full internet-connected diagnostics suite that is compatible with the current AD. So for major issues, you may have to return to the AD for proper solutions, and the price may not be good for the pocket.\n5. How much will it cost for you to continue the subscriptions after the free 3/5 years period for the digital features? Do you think you can live with / without those features?\n6. If you intend to trade in your car, what is the current COE situation like, and how would future changes impact your current valuation? You can try getting trade-in estimates from the various platform and dealers. You have to take into account that the depreciation for the current car is constant, and if the COE is expected to drop, your trade in value will also decrease. That means, waiting for lower COE when you intend to trade-in / sell may not actually make much difference overall.\n7. COE and instalments. Do some quick math, how much does a 10K up/down shift in the COE affect your new monthly instalments and depreciation? You may find the differences not that great, but beware of falling into the classic loop of \"just top up a bit more only\". Take this into account with the previous point about trade in valuation.\n8. Have you spoken with the SA for the new model that you're interested in?

So far, I like the **R15** the most, but many people say the **MT-15** is more suitable for daily commuting. When comparing a **sportbike and a street bike**, the street bike is definitely **more comfortable** for long distances, but I **can\u2019t stand the wind**. On the other hand, while the **R15 is less comfortable**, I feel that it suits me better overall.\n\n**My Situation**\n\nFor context, I currently have a **full-time job and part-time studies**. I have some savings, but I **don\u2019t wish to touch them** because I know that even a **2B bike isn\u2019t cheap** to maintain in Singapore. The cost of **fuel, servicing, wear and tear, parking fees, insurance, road tax, etc.** can add up quickly. I\u2019d rather keep my savings for these expenses and **emergencies**.\n\nOn average, I **commute about 60km daily** (Monday to Friday) from the **west to the east**, and taking public transport would take at least **two hours**. I also plan to use the bike as my **main mode of transport** and occasionally ride to **Johor Bahru on weekends**.\n\n**My Long-Term Plans**\n\nI enjoy riding and definitely plan to **upgrade to Class 2A and eventually Class 2** in the future. However, buying a **Class 2A or Class 2 bike** is **not going to happen anytime soon\u2014at least not within the next 3\u20134 years**.

I don\u2019t ride in the **first lane** unless necessary (e.g., overtaking or avoiding hazards), so I **don\u2019t feel an urgent need** to upgrade to a bigger bike anytime soon.\n\n**My Current Plan**\n\nI\u2019m looking to **buy a second-hand R15** (or possibly an **MT-15**, since the prices are similar). I plan to take a **loan of up to $10K**, depending on the cost of the bike:\n\n\u2022 If the bike costs **$12K**, I will **downpay $2K** and loan the remaining **$10K**.\n\n\u2022 If it costs **$7K**, I might **take a full loan** of **$7K**.\n\nNow, here\u2019s my main concern:\n\n**Should I get a bike with 3\u20134 years of COE left or one with 7\u20138 years of COE left?**\n\n**After Some Research:**\n\n**R15 (likely similar for MT-15)**\n\n\u2022 **3\u20134 years COE left (expiring in 2028/2029, R15V3)** \u2192 Costs **$7K\u2013$8K**\n\n\u2022 **7\u20138 years COE left (expiring in 2032/2033, R15V4)** \u2192 Costs **$11K\u2013$13K**\n\n**Questions & Considerations**\n\n1. **When buying a second-hand bike, do modifications matter?**\n\n\u2022 Is it worth paying extra for a **modded bike** instead of getting a **stock bike with an extra 1-year COE + less mileage**?\n\n\u2022 Personally, I don\u2019t care much about the **aesthetics**, but I\u2019m fine with **functional mods** like a **better clutch lever, brakes, monoshock, and suspension**, as they improve **performance and durability**. (though these mods could offset the extra year of COE? I dk.. haha, cus I might also upgrade in the future for better performance and safety)\n\n2. **Would it be worth getting a bike with only 3\u20134 years of COE left?**\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s **cheaper upfront**, but I would still need to **renew the COE in four years**.\n\n\u2022 Is it hard to **sell a bike with only 1\u20132 years of COE left**?\n\n3. **Would it be better to invest in a bike with 7\u20138 years of COE left for peace of mind?**\n\n**Add on:**\n\nI\u2019m also **considering doing food delivery** for extra income, but I really **don\u2019t like having a box on an R15**.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my long post!

In the circuit, it is okay to drive slow especially when doing the courses. No demerit points for doing courses slowly (except VP and PP) so just do at your own pace. \n\n4. Please clarify with your instructor what are the proper safety checks to be done for each course because you can get points for incorrect checking.\n\n5. Ask your instructor to re-teach you lane changing. Judgement for lane changing comes with more road practice. If the vehicle in the other lane is getting bigger and bigger means he is driving faster than you so be careful at this point. Distance of the car behind can be judged by the size of the car. In difficult situations like what you experienced during your test, do not try to speed ahead of the vehicle in the next lane or change lane abruptly just to make it in time, even if you are near the junction. If you judge that you cannot finish lane changing, tell the tester you cannot complete the lane changing due to the speeding car behind. If you are not yet near the junction, just slow down and let the other car pass, then you change lane.\n\n6. For the IF during your 3rd test, I'm not exactly sure where you are talking about. But just remember, if you cannot tell if there are cars in front (after the yellow box) due to the \"last\" car ahead blocking your view and/or you think there is no space for your car if you proceed, you do not have to move off at green light. \n\n7. Don't be afraid to go for those peak hour lessons. If you can deal with heavy traffic and bus lanes on the road, you will be setting yourself up to be more ready and confident during your TP test. If you always only experience what is easy, you panick more when faced with the unexpected during your test.\n\nJust drive more, get more lessons if you need.

Same for car-sharing firms.\n\n3. As has been for decades, dealers are allowed to bid for customers. These dealers don't give a fuck about high COE because buyers will pay it via loan so they'll rocket the prices up to close deals and then blame it on mArKeT fOrCes.\n\n4. Gov doesn't do anything about it because (a) it is a semi-effective mechanism (despite PHV/rental abuse) at managing congestion which is a real thing on a land-scarce island.

Space is definitely a constraint - boot is small, and you can\u2019t recline your seat much. But the top down feeling makes up for it. Of course in our weather, I only put the top down in the evening else it\u2019s too hot. \n\nReliability is okay, as with any other Mazda/Japanese made car. Every generation of miata has its quirks that require fixes, but they\u2019re not super costly. For example, the ND is commonly known for 3 parts that fails - wheel bearing / window regulator / cooling coil. Apart from these items, it\u2019s just regular servicing. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking at a 2015 model, it\u2019s gna be the NC.

For daily driving tbh it depends on your needs. Since you have only your wife and you I would say it\u2019s perfectly livable with. Heck you can even fit 2 carry on luggage in the boot. Don\u2019t expect to be bringing around golf clubs or long items tho. The ride is however low alr in stock and you are pretty much sitting in race car position compared to a normal SUV or Sedan and your wife might complain on how hard to get in/out and not like such a low sitting. Also stock suspension is stiff (not as stiff as aftermarket tho) and you feel every hump and every vibration (it\u2019s almost like a legal gokart) so if you can live with that!\n\n2. When I first got it, I brought it to Eurokars for a 3 servicing package of 1.2k. Tbh during that time, my engine mount failed and my right wheel bearing started humming but Eurokars never bothered with fixing it. So I recently brought my miata to and independent (just yesterday actually) for servicing and to get all the issues checked out. The engine mounts cost me 580 both sides and the wheel bearing cost me 485. Granted the car is 2 months to 9 years old so it\u2019s expected. Other than that it\u2019s been pretty reliable and never gave me a single issue. Parts are definitely also readily available as the inline 4 is the same engine in every other Mazda out there with slight differences only. (6, CX-5 etc.)\n\n3. Manual. But they are going to be more expensive and harder to find. People who buy the Miata know what they are buying and this car commands a higher price in manual. Not a Z4 that people buy to flex.\n\n4. I personally went for the soft top on my ND cos I love the flat convertible look instead of the targa look of the RF, tho the RF does look very good without the top down. The soft top opens and closes in 1 second manually and I really appreciate that. But if you want a transformer by all means the hard top. All personal preference. I drive top down almost on a weekly basis in the morning when I go to work or in the night when it\u2019s cool. Never in the afternoon or evening much tho unless the weather is 28 degrees or below.\n\nAll the best for your miata hunting!

The only fuel additive has proven to work is called PEA (Phenethylamine). It reduces carbon buildup. \n\nThe great thing is all fuel in Singapore contains some percentage of PEA. Some contain more than others- usually, a brand's \"premium\" fuel contains the most. So, V-Power, Platinum with Techron, Synergy Supreme+ etc. are all just 98 octane with more PEA. \n\nPEA is a good thing (as it really does work).
